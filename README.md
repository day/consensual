#Consensual 
* Provides a framework for relationships
* Is built on the principle of voluntary mutual agreement
* Enables participants to articulate offers and requests
* Facilitates transparency by tracking resource and energy flows

###Work in Progress
The idea is big (and I'm being vague on purpose), but the app is small (as you can see). I'm using this as an opportunity to explore a Meteor, Cordova, and Famo.us. Eventually, I plan to seek funding, but it's barely more than a twinkle in my eye at this point.

###Current Status
It's a handy todo list that anybody can edit.

View it here: http://consensu.al

###Project Roadmap
* Toggle public/private tasks
* View other users public tasks
* Propose a task for another user; that user can accept or reject it
* View agreements with another user (proposed & accepted)
* Status of proposals (pending|accepted|rejected)
* Revise and resubmit proposals
* Two-way proposals: Trade one task for another; one in your list for one in theirs.
